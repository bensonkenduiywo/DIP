### Background

The goal of this tutorial is to introduce practical aspects of digital image analysis/processing (DIP/DIA) principles in R. 

### Structure

A section of the tutorials introduces the basics of data manipulation in R for the novice users while the other sections contains tutorials related to DIP. The tutorial is organized as follows:

1. [Manipulating data in R: Excercise 1](ex1_intro2R.html).
2. [Solutions to Exercise 1](ex1_intro2R_answers.html).
3. [Data storage schema: Excercise 2](lesson1.html).


### Resources

We will use R software. R software is opensource and can be downloaded from https://cran.r-project.org/. A suitable R user interface that we shall use is [R Studio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). First download and install the latest version of R followed by the editor (RStudio). Other editors are available and you are free to use depending on your preference or previous experience. You will also need [Git](https://gitforwindows.org/) for version control in Rstudio and your [Github](https://github.com/) account. For more details on version control with Git in rstudio [click here](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200532077-Version-Control-with-Git-and-SVN).
